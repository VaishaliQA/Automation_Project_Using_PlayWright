# Automated Website Testing with Playwright, Mocha, and Cucumber

This repository contains an automated testing framework for web applications built using JavaScript with the Playwright tool. The framework is structured with Mocha to provide a clean and modular test architecture, and Cucumber is integrated to bridge the gap between technical implementation and business requirements through Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

## Features:
- **Playwright**: Ensures reliable and fast end-to-end testing across multiple browsers.
- **Mocha**: Provides a robust and structured approach to writing and organizing tests.
- **Cucumber**: Enables clear and human-readable test scenarios for collaboration with stakeholders.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Validates application functionality on various browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
